I will be gone from home for quite some time, and I would love to be able to call each and every one of you on a regular schedule, but with the time difference and life, I don't think it will be possible. So... a blog!

For those of you who I forgot to explain my trip to, or if you want a refresher here's what my current itinerary looks like:

China for 10 days-- with the Program on the Environment trip focusing on Sustainability in the US and China. This program is what started the planning of this whole trip, so a huge shout out to the PoE and Kristi Straus for making it happen. I am so excited to learn more about China's sustainability policies from students and professors at Tsinghua, as it is one of two top schools in China. I don't know exactly what I'll be doing in at the site visits and with our free time, but we have a busy schedule each day. I'm also really looking forward to visiting the Great Wall of China and the Forbidden City, especially after learning about the Great Wall in my architecture history course this quarter.

Australia for two weeks-- This portion of the trip is not affiliated with a UW program, but I will be staying with someone that Fi met on her gap year, so I won't be entirely alone. I cannot wait to connect to the climbing community in AUS, and I'll need some time to warm up after China! (Also I've wanted to go to Australia since I was about 5 years old.) If anyone has recomendaitons of things to do around Melbourne, let me know!

Thailand for three months-- Growing up and living in the the PNW my whole life, I've never had a sunny winter, and I'm very excited about being in Thailand for this winter quarter. I am going with a CHID program titled Gender, Human Rights, and Livelihood in Exile. I am expecting this to be a truly eye-opening experience, especially when we go on site visits to a refugee camp, rural villigas, and different NGOs that specialize in rehabilitation of individuals that have been sex trafficked.

There will most likely be a few additional stops, and I will definitely need to leave Thailand at some point to get my visa exemption renewed, so maybe I'll stop by Vietnam, Cambodia, or Laos. Again, any recommendations are welcome. 

Thank you for takChina
12/9 
On the plane, I've still got about 6 hours left to go. I've already taken a nap, watched Crazy Rich Asians, and tried to walk around the plane without running into every person along the way. It still hasn't quite hit me that when I land, I'll be in China, and I won't go back to Seattle until March. I'm going to miss so many people, events and memories while I'm gone, but I know that I'm going to have an incredible time and learn so many things the time to keep up with me, let me know if you read this!

at I didn't even know I could learn.
