#Welcome to my blog!

I will be gone from home for quite some time, and I would love to be able to call each and every one of you on a regular schedule, but with the time difference and life, I don't think it will be possible. So... a blog!

For those of you who I forgot to explain my trip to, or if you want a refresher here's what my current itinerary looks like:

China for 10 days-- with the Program on the Environment trip focusing on Sustainability in the US and China. This program is what started the planning of this whole trip, so a huge shout out to the PoE and Kristi Straus for making it happen. I am so excited to learn more about China's sustainability policies from students and professors at Tsinghua, as it is one of two top schools in China. I don't know exactly what I'll be doing in at the site visits and with our free time, but we have a busy schedule each day. I'm also really looking forward to visiting the Great Wall of China and the Forbidden City, especially after learning about the Great Wall in my architecture history course this quarter.

Australia for two weeks-- This portion of the trip is not affiliated with a UW program, but I will be staying with someone that Fi met on her gap year, so I won't be entirely alone. I cannot wait to connect to the climbing community in AUS, and I'll need some time to warm up after China! (Also I've wanted to go to Australia since I was about 5 years old.) If anyone has recomendaitons of things to do around Melbourne, let me know!

Thailand for three months-- Growing up and living in the the PNW my whole life, I've never had a sunny winter, and I'm very excited about being in Thailand for this winter quarter. I am going with a CHID program titled Gender, Human Rights, and Livelihood in Exile. I am expecting this to be a truly eye-opening experience, especially when we go on site visits to a refugee camp, rural villigas, and different NGOs that specialize in rehabilitation of individuals that have been sex trafficked.

There will most likely be a few additional stops, and I will definitely need to leave Thailand at some point to get my visa exemption renewed, so maybe I'll stop by Vietnam, Cambodia, or Laos. Again, any recommendations are welcome. 

Thank you for taking the time to keep up with me, let me know if you read this! 







## China

**12/9** 
On the plane, I've still got about 6 hours left to go. I've already taken a nap, watched Crazy Rich Asians, and tried to walk around the plane without running into every person along the way. It still hasn't quite hit me that when I land, I'll be in China, and I won't go back to Seattle until March. I'm going to miss so many people, events and memories while I'm gone, but I know that I'm going to have an incredible time and learn so many things thdidn't even know I needed to learn.

We had breakfast in the hotel, and I'm still not comfortable with the huge meals, but I think I'll get used to it soon enough! I had a taro bun, sesame balls, a steamed bun, shredded carrot, corn soup and what seemed like zuchinni in gravy. I don't understand how the Chinese eat so much and how most of them seem to stay fairly healthy. We haven't been snacking but we've had three big meals a day. I think it has something to do with how cold it is, or at least I'll blame it on that for now. 

We went to a classroom on campus and got to meet out Tsinghua classmates, most of whom are actually exchange students who are just spending a few months in Beijing. In my small group one boy is from Japan and one is from Korea, so I think we'll have a lot to talk about in our final presentation (the topic is tbd but we might dive into the demand and solutions for disposable plastic products). I can't imagine studying abroad at such a prestigious university, I would feel inadequate and completely out of my comfort zone. One of the the UW students was trying to explain how hard it is to get into a good university, and it made me incredibly thankful that I did not grow up here. Students all take one test and get ranked, then they can choose which school to go to based on that rank. At dinner, one of the Tsinghua students was explaining that there are different grading standards for the different exchange countries, which might make it a bit easier to do well in courses, but not by that much.  Is there a way to standardize education in order to accommodate for language barriers or influences? I feel like there is no way to completely bridge the gap between entirely different systems, but I do not know.

We started our day today with a history lecture by Lu Yang, an esteemed professor from Peking University. We got a brief overview of the history of Chang'an, and the different emperors that came before Beijing as we know it today. I think the most interesting thing that we learned was the ways in which written language was used for propaganda, and how important it was in upholding the beliefs and power of the emperors. // We went to the school cafeteria for lunch, which was incredubly packed and full of all different kinds of food. I decided to take it easy and not order food on my own with no Chinese, and instead just went to the counter where you pick up plates of whatever you want. There options spanned the length of an entire wall of the open room, but I got rice, bok choy, broccoli and tofu, which was all good but not as hot as I would've liked. At our table we were talking about how efficient the system seems to be and how something of that nature would most likely not work at UW. It seems like that they have a lot more options than us in terms of buying fresh food at a market or eating a plethora of things in the cafeteria, so I wonder what the other universities in the area have in way of dining halls.  

Our field trip today was to an environmental monitoring program, which was seemed like it would be a valuable experience, but was not English-friendly. One of the native Chinese speakers in our group was trying to translate everything for us, but it was hard to not be able to understand all of the infographics on the walls. We were trying to learn about air pollution I think, but to be honest most all of it went over my head and I didn't get a lot out of the trip. I have been realizing more and more just how difficult it is to feel interested in something when you are unable to understand the language.

One thing that seems to be very easy to appreciate is the food, and we continued our trend of huge meals. We had dinner at a hot pot place, but we got there an hour before we needed to, so a group of us went out with our professor in search of a bar. Someone in the group thought they knew of a place to go, but the map led us to a random hole-in-the-wall store that seemed to only be selling Chinese medicine. The looks that we were getting from people were pretty entertaining, but it would've been nice if we could've gotten somewhere. It's challenging for me to led someone else take on the navigation and just hope for the best! The dinner itself was great, again, but I do not think I can sustain this level of eating. We had four types of tofu and tons of veggies in a mushroom broth, and had fruit and sesame mochi bites for dessert. The restaraut is apparently known for its service, and I can see why. They had one man that stretched noodles for us as we were watching, and a performance from mask-changing man (he was wearing an elaborate looking costume and would change out his masks without using his hands? not really sure the origins or point). It's a great opportunity to get to know the people on our trip and get to think more on the experiences from the day.
